title: "Automatic Sound event recognition of traffic and community noise"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017_thesis
excerpt: 'Audio content analysis of real world recordings instead of common SPL measures is proposed as 
a technique for environmental noise evaluation. However, because of the large quantity of data that 
a  monitoring  system  produces  an  automatic sound  event  algorithm  was  built  using  audio 
descriptors  as MFCC,  spectral  centroid,  zcr  and  roll  off  coupled  with  a  supervised  learning 
approach with SVM'
