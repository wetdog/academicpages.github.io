excerpt: 'This paper presents the combination of different noise monitoring systems (conventional and low-cost), 
combined with data analysis procedures to manage the big amount of data coming from long term acoustic monitoring in real world cases.
Signal processing and machine learning techniques are used to solve higher requirements in noise monitoring. Direct measurements are difficult
and expensive for many situations due to non-permanent sources in urban areas and conventional monitoring systems just giving noise levels
information are not enough to identify the noise sources along time'
