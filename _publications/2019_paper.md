excerpt: 'This paper presents the combination of different noise monitoring systems (conventional and low-cost), 
combined with data analysis procedures to manage the big amount of data coming from long term acoustic monitoring in real world cases.
Signal processing and machine learning techniques are used to solve higher requirements in noise monitoring. Noise is getting a more relevant
role in the environmental urban management and awareness is growing to include actions to reduce its annoyance, demanding a better description
of noise problems and the identification of sources with their contribution to a specific situation. Direct measurements are difficult
and expensive for many situations due to non-permanent sources in urban areas and conventional monitoring systems just giving noise levels
information are not enough to identify the noise sources along time. To respond to variable situations, 
flexible methods will be presented using environments that mix noise from recreational, transportation and other sources. 
Those sonic environments will be studied combining analysis of SPL data in short intervals with audio data processed through
a pre-trained tuned model from Audioset and own recorded databases, trying ultimately to self-identify the contribution of specific
noise sources related with annoyance in specific sounds environments. '
